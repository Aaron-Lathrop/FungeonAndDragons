      <div class="content">
        <p>At the beginning of the quest, Phuk came to, perplexed to find herself in a dark, foul-smelling shaft. Thankfully her night-vision allows her to see the path in front of her. She turned around and saw a creature she had never encountered before, a lime-green flaming school. Though her knowledge is limited on this sort of creature, she knows that it’s not something to trifle with and proceeds to run down the cavern in front of her. Unfortunately she didn’t have good footing as she ran forward and tumbled, scraping her knee and rolling down an uneven section but saw light coming in from some entry ahead of her. Glancing back, the flame-skull pursued her until she finally emerged outside where he surprisingly stopped.</p>
        <p>Unbeknownst to her, six others emerged from this exit, having come from different tunnels all leading to the same field she currently stood.</p>
        <p>Turning her head, Phuk spoke to the closest of these apparent strangers, “What the fuck was that?!”</p>
        <p>He was as confused as her. She proceeds to ask, “Why were you in there?”</p>
        <p>The stranger furrows his brow before he utters, “....I’m not sure.”</p>
        <p>“Are you headed to Saint Doodlesburg too?”</p>
        <p>He nods and peering off in the distance, Phuk can see a large bald man continue to run his crossbow drawn. She thought, “Had he engaged the flame-skull? Is he mad?”</p>
        <p>In the corner of her eye she can see another smaller, perhaps a half-ling, running as fast as his two short legs carry him. He ran towards the closest person near him, clutching onto her leg like some scared child. Instead of comforting him, this person just kicked him off her leg, uttering words that were too distant to hear, Phuk is sure it was along the lines of, “Get off, half-ling!”</p>
        <p>Turning around, looking at the opening, there is one flame-skull laughing menaichaly. Another emerged out of the shaft that the bald creature had come from and blew a green flaming ball crashed, nearly hitting him. The other skulls emerge, looking onward to the flaming spectacle and all laugh. Phuk and the other strangers move away quickly from the quick spreading green, flames burning the dry grass in the meadow. After swiftly moving further away, all congregate in the middle of the open field.</p>
